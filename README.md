### Welcome to my ft_server repository 👋

⭐️ The goal of this subject was to discover Docker and setup a web server with simple services (Wordpress, Phpmyadmin, MySQL)

## 💡 Usage

Install docker on your system then run the following commands :

```
docker build -t "<em>name</em>"
docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -it "<em>name</em>" --name "random_name"
```
